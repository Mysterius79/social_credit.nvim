# IMPORTANT
This plugin was written in about 2 hours as a joke (because of a chat message in ThePrimeagen's chat, but I can't find the message), so don't expect the code to work well or to be somewhat user friendly

# INSTALLATION
Download the `main.lua` file and drop it into your configuration path and type `:so` to source the plugin
